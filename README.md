Sometimes, all we need is a way to quickly type a TeX equation and turn it into an image (looking at you, Powerpoint). With this
quick and dirty solution, you can do so. The primary change to existing editors (such as KaTeX's own playground) is that this
solution allows you to quickly change the equation render size to make it as large as possible, which is a tad cumbersome with
other editors.

There's no magic involved, it's just a static HTML page with a few convenience functions. Go have fun with it.
